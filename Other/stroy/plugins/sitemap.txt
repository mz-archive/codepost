This topic is about the GetSimple Sitemap plugin. It is a plugin that automatically generates an ordered tree-like sitemap of your pages, giving visitors a complete overview of your website. Comments, bugs and feature requests can be posted here.

Installation

Download the latest version here, unzip the downloaded file and copy its contents to your plugins folder. To show a sitemap, go to the Pages tab and add the following placeholder to a page of your choice:

(% sitemap %)

Instead of using placeholders you can also add a sitemap directly to your template (in the sidebar for instance), using:

<?php sm_show(); ?>

That's it, Enjoy!
